A simple image viewer that combines Imagemagick and Cyotek.Windows.Forms.ImageBox.

After using IrfanView, XnView and FastStone images viewers over time, but never being quite satisfied with the feature set of any sinple application, I made my own.  

My modest requirements were that it should have a directory tree to be able to navigate my drives for images, and those should be shown as thumbnails. 
Double-clicking on an image should open it up in a separate window that can be scrolled and zoomed with the mouse wheel.

Added some niceties like full-screen mode with F11, context-menu options to change magnification filter and zoom levels, and showing images on the clipboard.
